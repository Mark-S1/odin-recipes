		<li>450g Italian sausage</li>
		<li>350g beef</li>
		<li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
		<li>2 cloves crushed garlic</li>
		<li>800g crushed tomatoes</li>
		<li>370g tomato sauce</li>
		<li>340g tomato paste</li>
		<li>1/2 cup water</li>
		<li>2 tbsp white sugar</li>
		<li>4 tbsp fresh parsley</li>
		<li>1.5 tsp dried basil</li>
		<li>1.5 tsp salt</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp fennel seeds</li>
		<li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
		<li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
		<li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
		<li>3/4 cup parmesan cheese</li>
		<li>340g mozzarella cheese</li>
		<li>450g ricotta cheese</li>
		<li>1 egg</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Cook beef, onion, and garlic in a large pot over medium heat until browned.</li>
		<li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tbsp parsley, basil, 1 tsp salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Cover and simmer for about 1.5 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
		<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8-10 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
		<li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tbsp parsley, and 1/2 tsp salt</li>
		<li>Preheat oven to 190 deg C</li>
		<li>To assemble, spread 1.5 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 23x33cm baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1.5 cups of meat sauce over the mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese.</li>
		<li>Repeat layers and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with oil or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
		<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
		<li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
	</ol>
